# Netflix Clone

This is a Netflix clone built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It replicates the basic functionality and design of the popular streaming platform, allowing users to browse movies and TV shows, view details, and sign up for an account.
